DESCRIPTION:

The sample contains a wrapper non-visual part for IVKeySortedSet.  You may
ask why you have to do this, this is because Visual Builder does not generate
codes correctly for the template class that has more than one pamaraters with
the current release of VAC++ V3.0.  IVkeySortedSet is a template class and
it requires 2 parameters.


How to build the wrapper part:

 - create an VBE file for the wrapper part which inherits from IVKeySortedSet
   and then import it in VB, see the included vbe file IMYKYSRT.VBE.

 Note: You don't need to rebuild this part if you plan to use the
       IVKeySortedSet collection, just load up mycc.vbb.

How to use this wrapper part in a VB part:

 - Load up VBCC.VBB and then MYCC.VBB in the VB main dialog box.
 - Add/Drop IMyKeySortedSet part onto the f/f surface.  For more details,
   refer to test.vbb
 - Edit the global key acess function in keyacc.cpp to work with your
   collection.  For example, the sample contains the collection of pointers
   to APerson objects, the Name attribute of APerson is the key whose type
   is IString.
 - Include keyacc.hpp in the part where the collection is used. In the
   sample, the collection is used in the APerson part.  For more details
   on the implementation of IVKeySortedSet, refer to the Open Class User's
   Guide and Open Class online reference.

 Note: before using the IMyKeySortedSet part, it is required to load up
       VBCC.VBB first.  This VBB contains the definitions for IVKeySortedSet.
